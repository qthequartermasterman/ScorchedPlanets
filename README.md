# ScorchedPlanets
Scorched Planets is a video game inspired by the classic "Scorched Earth", in which tanks take turns blasting each other on destructible terrain. Scorched Planets, however, does not take place in the small, simple regions of Scorched Earth, but instead uses entire destructible planets as its setting. Scorched Planets also features Newtonian Gravity.

Scorched Planets was originally written in C++, as part of a collaborative school project. This is an online multiplayer port using a Python server and javascript client.
